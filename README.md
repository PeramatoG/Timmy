# Timmy
Offline-first voice command assistant for lighting consoles and OSC-controlled systems.

## Headless build and tests

The reusable audio module, CLI, and deterministic tests can be built without
wxWidgets, a display server, or an audio input device:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DTIMMY_BUILD_GUI=OFF -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The test suite feeds in-memory sample data through TIMMY's public audio APIs;
it does not open a microphone.
